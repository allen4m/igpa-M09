                  Dear International Admissions Colleagues,
                </p>

                <p className="mb-6">
                  I wanted to share something that has been close to my heart for quite some time now.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-6">
                  As the Director of International Admission, DSO, and ARO at a private liberal arts university, 
                  I've walked in your shoes. Each recruitment cycle, my small team and I process around 2,000 
                  applications with limited resources and an ever-tightening budget. Those hours spent with 
                  constrained eyes, meticulously deciphering international transcripts and converting GPAs? 
                  I understand that challenge deeply.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-6">
                  While I'm not a coder myself, my experiences in this field helped me envision a tool that 
                  could make our lives easier. After immersing myself in UX design research, I was fortunate 
                  to connect with the wonderful folks at the Insight Digital Agency. They are professional, 
                  friendly, polite, efficient and highly customer experience focused (that doesn't mean they 
                  won't say no to your ridiculous or unrealistic requests). Their genuine curiosity about our 
                  work and commitment to solving real problems made this collaboration truly special.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-6">
                  And so, with a lot of heart and hard work, the International GPA Calculator was born.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-6">
                  I created this tool because I understand what our days look like. Many of us manage 
                  international admissions in small teamsâ€”sometimes as the only full-time staff member, 
                  supported by amazing but temporary student workers. We juggle complex global grading systems 
                  that require specialized knowledge, and maintaining consistency can feel impossible with 
                  changing personnel. This calculator aims to standardize our processes, serve as a training 
                  resource for new team members, and build institutional knowledge that stays even as people 
                  move on.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-6">
                  About those existing GPA conversion tools... we all know they come with eye-watering price 
                  tags. And despite the cost, they often lack features that would actually make our lives 
                  easier. That's why I made a promise that our core functionality would always be free. I 
                  believe that having the right tools shouldn't depend on the size of your department's budget.

                  This project came from a place of genuine care for our profession and community. It's built
